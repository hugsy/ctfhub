# CTFPad

## What

A webapp for managing CTFs by teams playing [CTFs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame_(hacking)). If you're looking for a platform for hosting CTFs use [CTFd](https://github.com/ctfd/ctfd).


## Build


For most people, this will suffice:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hugsy/ctfpad
$ cd ctfpad
$ cp .env.example .env
### CHANGE THE CREDENTIALS IN .env ###
$ nano .env
### BUILD EXCALIDRAW USING .env VARIABLES ###
$ make build
$ docker compose up -d --build
```

If you want to use SSL locally, follow the [instructions to generate local SSL certificates](./conf/README.md)
and run:

```
$ cp .env.nginx-proxy.example .env
$ docker compose -f docker-compose-proxy.yml -f docker-compose.yml up -d --build

```

## Why

I was fed up of not finding a tool to my liking to manage CTFs for teams playing so I wrote one. You should probably not use it ðŸ˜‹ I wrote it quickly because I really couldn't find something that fitted my needs. Some other projects of the sort of collaboration during CTFs:

 - [CTFPad](https://github.com/StratumAuhuur/CTFPad): nice project but NodeJS, so yeah. Also  [`etherpad-lite`](https://yopad.eu) doesn't support MarkDown easily. I like the name, so I took it shamelessly
 - [rizzoma](http://rizzoma.com/): a horrible outdated collaborative platform, poorly suited for CTFs.

I discovered [HedgeDoc](https://demo.hedgedoc.org/features?both) (aka. old CodiMD), an awesome platform, 100% Markdown, easily integrable. This project is just an eye-candy around using HedgeDoc as a central platform when doing a challenge collaboratively.

It's a toy project, so there's a lot of TODOs, features will be added (slowly).
