If you just like the tool, consider dropping on Discord (or Twitter or other) a simple *"thanks"*, it is always very appreciated.

And if you can, consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/hugsy/sponsors) - it really helps dedicating time and resources to the projects!


## Extra Credits

- [CTFPad](https://github.com/StratumAuhuur/CTFPad): nice project but NodeJS, so yeah. Also [`etherpad-lite`](https://yopad.eu) doesn't support MarkDown easily. I like the name, so I took it shamelessly
- The world flag images are downloaded from https://flagpedia.net/
